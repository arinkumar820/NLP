    "## Tokenization Concepts and Importance in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization** is the process of splitting text into meaningful segments: *sentence tokenization* splits paragraphs into sentences, and *word tokenization* splits sentences into words. This is a key pre-processing step in NLP pipelines    .\n",
    "- Simple rules like splitting sentences by a period (`.`) are insufficient due to language complexities (e.g., \"Dr.\" does not indicate sentence end). Tokenization requires language-specific rules and understanding to handle such exceptions correctly   .\n",
    "- SpaCy provides built-in tokenizers that intelligently handle prefixes, suffixes, exceptions, punctuation, and currency symbols, making tokenization more accurate than naive splitting by spaces     .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using SpaCy for Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "- To use SpaCy, install it via `pip install spacy`, then import and create a language object with `spacy.blank('en')` for English or other language codes (e.g., `de` for German, `hi` for Hindi)    .\n",
    "- Creating a `Doc` object by passing text to an `nlp` object automatically tokenizes the text into word tokens accessible via iteration or indexing, e.g., `for token in doc` or `doc[0]`    .\n",
    "- Tokens in SpaCy are objects with many useful attributes and methods such as `.is_alpha`, `.is_digit`, `.is_currency`, `.text`, etc., allowing detailed text analysis beyond simple token text extraction      .\n",
    "- SpaCy treats symbols and punctuation as separate tokens, enabling precise token boundaries (e.g., `$` and `2` are distinct tokens)   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Token and Span Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- SpaCy represents tokens as `Token` objects and slices of tokens as `Span` objects, enabling extraction of substrings or token subsequences with Python-like slice syntax (e.g., `doc[1:5]`)   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Use Case: Extracting Emails\n",
    "\n",
    "- SpaCy can be used to process large text files by converting lines to a single string and creating a `Doc` for tokenization. Using token attributes (like an email detector), you can extract entities such as email addresses efficiently, sometimes more conveniently than regex      .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenization in Different Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "- SpaCy supports multiple languages, and tokenization respects language-specific rules. For example, Hindi tokenization can detect currency symbols and numbers correctly, though some languages may lack full pipeline support yet (e.g., Hindi currently has no pipeline)    .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customizing the Tokenizer\n",
    "\n",
    "- SpaCy's tokenizer can be customized to handle special cases or slang by adding rules that split tokens differently (e.g., splitting \"gimme\" into \"gim\" and \"me\") using SpaCy symbols and special case handlers      .\n",
    "- Customization respects that the original text should not be altered, only the tokenization behavior changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentence Tokenization with SpaCy Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blank SpaCy pipelines include only tokenization. To enable sentence tokenization, a `sentencizer` component must be added manually to the pipeline using `nlp.add_pipe('sentencizer')`   .\n",
    "- Full pipelines loaded from SpaCy models include multiple components (tagger, parser, named entity recognizer, etc.) for richer language understanding and better sentence splitting   .\n",
    "- The basic sentencizer may not fully resolve complex sentence boundary cases (e.g., splitting after \"Dr.\") but full models improve this accuracy  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises and Practical Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exercises include extracting URLs and monetary transactions from given text paragraphs using SpaCy tokenization and attribute methods, reinforcing practical NLP skills    .\n",
    "- Emphasis on hands-on practice: watching tutorials alone is insufficient; active coding and problem solving are crucial for mastering NLP and becoming a successful NLP engineer    .\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> **💡 Key Insight:** Tokenization is foundational for all NLP tasks, but requires nuanced language-specific rules beyond simple splitting. SpaCy's tokenizer and pipeline components provide powerful, customizable tools for accurate token and sentence segmentation, enabling advanced text analysis and extraction tasks.   "

    "## Stemming and Lemmatization in NLP Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** Both stemming and lemmatization reduce words to their base or root form, which helps in NLP tasks like text classification and search (e.g., mapping \"talking,\" \"talked,\" and \"talk\" to the base word \"talk\")   .\n",
    "- **Benefit:** Mapping different word forms to a base form improves consistency and accuracy in NLP applications such as sentiment analysis by treating variations of a word as the same token  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stemming: Rule-Based Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition:** Stemming applies a fixed set of simple heuristic rules to strip suffixes or prefixes from words to obtain a root form (e.g., removing \"ing\" from \"talking\" to get \"talk\") without language understanding   .\n",
    "- **Examples of suffix removal:**  \n",
    "  - \"ing\" → talking, walking, running → talk, walk, run  \n",
    "  - \"able\" → adjustable, removable → adjust, remove  \n",
    "- **Limitations:** Stemming can produce non-words (e.g., \"ability\" reduced to \"abil\") because it does not consider linguistic context or meaning  .\n",
    "- **Tools:** NLTK supports multiple stemmers like Porter and Snowball stemmers and is often used because it is fast and simple, though less accurate than lemmatization    .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lemmatization: Linguistically Informed Reduction\n",

    "  Creating a Porter stemmer object and applying `.stem()` to words removes suffixes based on fixed rules, e.g., \"eating\" → \"eat,\" \"adjustable\" → \"adjust\" (though sometimes resulting in invalid roots)    .\n",
    "- **spaCy Lemmatization Example:**  \n",
    "  Loading an English model and iterating over tokens allows access to `token.lemma_` which returns the lemma, e.g., \"ate\" → \"eat,\" \"adjustable\" → \"adjustable,\" preserving meaningful forms based on the model's vocabulary and rules    .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Customizing Lemmatization Behavior in spaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem:** Default language models may not recognize slang or custom words, e.g., \"bro\" remains \"bro\" as lemma  .\n",
    "- **Solution:** Customize the attribute ruler in spaCy's pipeline to assign specific lemmas to custom tokens (e.g., mapping \"bro\" and \"bra\" to lemma \"brother\") by adding custom rules to the attribute ruler component   .\n",
    "- **Effect:** After customization, queries for lemma return the assigned base word (e.g., \"bro\" → \"brother\") enhancing model adaptability to domain-specific vocabulary  .\n",

    "## Feature Engineering in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature engineering** is a crucial step in the machine learning pipeline where data scientists spend considerable time extracting meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance  .\n",
    "- A **feature** is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. For example, in a property price prediction problem, features include area, facilities, age of the home, and location   .\n",
    "- In image classification, features correspond to distinguishable parts such as eyes, nose, ears, and whiskers that help identify objects like cats or dogs   .\n",
    "- Neural networks identify features by assigning specific tasks to individual neurons, such as detecting cat ears or noses; if all relevant features are detected, the network confirms the presence of a cat   .\n",
    "- Human intuition works similarly when recognizing images, sometimes rejecting images if features like ears or nose do not match expectations, illustrating how feature detection influences classification  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Representation as Feature Engineering in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text data must be converted into numerical features because machine learning models cannot directly process raw text; this conversion is a core part of **feature engineering** in NLP, often called **text representation**   .\n",
    "- Unlike images or tabular data, text features are less obvious; one approach is to define handcrafted features such as whether a word represents a person, location, or other categories, assigning binary values (e.g., \"Dhoni\" as person = 1, location = 0)   .\n",
    "- Words can be represented as **vectors** (sets of numbers) rather than single numbers, enabling mathematical operations like **cosine similarity** to measure semantic similarity between words   .\n",
    "- For example, vectors for \"Dhoni\" and \"comments\" may have a high cosine similarity, indicating semantic closeness, while \"Dhoni\" and \"Australia\" may be less similar; this helps NLP models understand relationships between words beyond exact matches   .\n",
    "- This vector representation is also known as the **Vector Space Model**, which can be applied to various text units such as words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance and Approaches to Text Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Effective text representation is fundamental to NLP success; better feature extraction from text often leads to better model results than using sophisticated algorithms on poor representations   .\n",
    "- Common approaches to text representation include **one-hot encoding**, **bag of words**, and **TF-IDF**; one-hot encoding is less popular due to sparsity issues, while bag of words is widely used in classic NLP tasks like spam detection   .\n",
    "- Feature engineering in NLP is about transforming raw text into meaningful numerical vectors that capture semantic and syntactic properties, enabling machine learning algorithms to perform tasks like classification, sentiment analysis, and more   .\n",
    "\n",

    "## Introduction to Spam Detection and Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spam detection is a classical text classification problem within the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Gmail uses machine learning to accurately classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) by analyzing keywords and urgency cues in the text.   \n",
    "- Machine learning models only understand numerical data, so text must be converted into numerical vectors, a process known as text representation or feature engineering. This vectorization enables models like Naive Bayes classifiers to distinguish spam from ham.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Text Representation Approaches: Label Encoding and One Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Label Encoding:** Create a vocabulary from all unique words in the training emails, assign each word a unique numeric index, and represent a text by a list (vector) of these indices. This is a primitive way to convert text to numbers but is simple and intuitive.     \n",
    "- **One Hot Encoding:** Using the vocabulary, represent each word as a vector where the position corresponding to the word’s index is set to 1 and all other positions are 0. This creates sparse vectors indicating presence or absence of words.    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Disadvantages of Label Encoding and One Hot Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "| Disadvantage | Explanation |\n",
    "|--------------|-------------|\n",
    "| **1. Lack of semantic similarity** | One hot vectors treat all words as independent; similar words like \"help\" and \"assistance\" have completely different vectors, failing to capture meaning or similarity.    |\n",
    "| **2. High memory consumption** | Large vocabularies (e.g., 100,000 words) create very large vectors for each word, leading to excessive memory usage, especially for long texts with many words.    |\n",
    "| **3. Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem** | Words not in the vocabulary (e.g., new or rare words like \"bahubali\") cannot be accurately represented, often lumped into a generic \"unknown\" token, losing distinctiveness.    |\n",
    "| **4. Variable input size for models** | Different texts have different lengths, so flattening one hot vectors leads to inconsistent input sizes, which is problematic for fixed-size input requirements in machine learning models like neural networks.    |\n",
    "\n",
    "- Label encoding avoids the large vector size issue but still does not capture semantic relationships or solve the OOV problem. Both approaches are considered \"dumb\" or primitive for text representation in modern NLP.    \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Label encoding and one hot encoding are foundational but outdated methods for text representation due to their inability to encode meaning, inefficiency, and inflexibility.  \n",
    "- Modern NLP typically uses more advanced techniques such as word embeddings and TF-IDF to overcome these issues.\n",

    "## Bag of Words (BOW) Technique in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bag of Words is a text representation technique where a vocabulary of unique words is created from a corpus, and each document is represented as a vector of word counts based on that vocabulary. This vector is called a **count vectorizer**    .\n",
    "- Example: For news articles about companies like Tesla and Apple, key terms such as \"Elon Musk,\" \"Model 3,\" and \"iPhone\" help identify the company. Counting occurrences of these words in articles allows classification of the document by company    .\n",
    "- Vocabulary is built by collecting all unique words from documents (after stemming or lemmatization), which can be very large (e.g., 10,000+ words), leading to high-dimensional vectors   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing and Limitations of Bag of Words\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each document is transformed into a vector where each element is the frequency of a vocabulary word in that document. This results in a **sparse vector** because most words do not appear in every document, leading to many zero values   .\n",
    "- BOW does not capture word meanings or semantic similarity. For example, \"help\" and \"assistance\" are treated as different words despite similar meanings, resulting in different vector representations  .\n",
    "- BOW vectors are generally smaller than one-hot encoding vectors for individual words but still consume significant memory and computational resources due to sparsity   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Application: Spam Email Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tutorial uses BOW with a dataset of over 5,000 emails labeled as spam or non-spam (ham). The dataset is imbalanced with more non-spam emails   .\n",
    "- Labels are converted to numeric form (spam = 1, ham = 0) using pandas `apply` method with a lambda function or a custom function for transformation    .\n",
    "- Data is split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split` to avoid biased model evaluation    .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using CountVectorizer in Scikit-learn\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CountVectorizer` converts text documents into count vectors representing word frequencies. It builds the vocabulary and transforms emails into sparse matrices    .\n",
    "- The sparse matrix can be converted to a dense NumPy array for inspection. The vocabulary size in the example is 7,675 unique words    .\n",
    "- Vocabulary words can be accessed and indexed to understand which word corresponds to which position in the vector, aiding interpretation of the feature vectors    .\n",
    "- Non-zero elements in vectors correspond to words present in the email; their indices map back to vocabulary words, showing how the vector represents the text content      .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building and Evaluating a Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "- A multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is used because it suits discrete count data like word frequencies. The model is trained by calling the `fit` method on training vectors and labels    .\n",
    "- The test emails are transformed using the same `CountVectorizer` and predictions are made. Performance is evaluated using `classification_report` from scikit-learn, which provides precision, recall, and F1-score, important metrics especially for imbalanced datasets    .\n",
    "- Example: Emails with phrases like \"55 million dollars\" and \"exclusive offer\" are typically predicted as spam, demonstrating the model's practical utility   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplifying Workflow with Scikit-learn Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scikit-learn's `Pipeline` allows chaining of preprocessing (`CountVectorizer`) and classification (`MultinomialNB`) into a single object, simplifying code and avoiding manual vector transformations during training and prediction    .\n",

    "## Bag of n-grams and Vocabulary Challenges\n",
    "- Traditional bag of words models do not solve the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem, where new words in prediction are unseen during training and thus hard to vectorize. This limitation affects performance and memory usage  .\n",
    "- The `CountVectorizer` class from sklearn supports an `n_gram_range` parameter, allowing generation of n-grams beyond unigrams (single words). Setting `n_gram_range=(2,2)` creates bigrams; `(1,3)` includes unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams in the vocabulary   .\n",
    "- N-grams capture sequences of tokens, e.g., bigrams are pairs of consecutive words, which can provide richer contextual information than single tokens  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Preprocessing for Vectorization\n",
    "- Preprocessing includes removing stop words and lemmatization (reducing words to their base form), implemented using the spaCy library. Tokens identified as stop words or punctuation are filtered out, and lemmas are joined back into a string for vectorization     .\n",
    "- Example: \"Loki is eating pizza\" preprocesses to \"Loki eat pizza,\" removing \"is\" (stop word) and converting \"eating\" to its lemma \"eat\"  .\n",
    "- Preprocessing improves the quality of input text before applying n-gram vectorization, making vectors more representative of the core content  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectorization and Representation\n",
    "- After preprocessing, applying `CountVectorizer` with `n_gram_range=(1,2)` generates a vocabulary including unigrams and bigrams, with each token or n-gram assigned an index for vector representation  .\n",
    "- Text is converted to numeric vectors using the vector space model, essential because machine learning models require numeric input rather than raw text  .\n",
    "- Example: A sentence like \"Thor eat pizza\" is transformed into a sparse vector indicating presence (1) or absence (0) of vocabulary tokens or n-grams     .\n",
    "- OOV words (e.g., \"Hulk\" not in training vocabulary) cannot be represented, illustrating the OOV problem in practice  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## News Category Classification Dataset and Handling Imbalance\n",
    "- The dataset used contains news articles labeled into six categories (e.g., business, sports, science), loaded into a pandas DataFrame from JSON format   .\n",
    "- Exploratory analysis shows class imbalance; some categories (like science) have fewer samples than others (business, sports)  .\n",
    "- To address imbalance, under-sampling is applied by randomly selecting the minimum number of samples present among classes (138 in this case) to create a balanced dataset, acknowledging that discarding data is generally not ideal in real scenarios    .\n",
    "- Balanced subsets for each category are concatenated row-wise using `pd.concat` to form a balanced DataFrame for training    .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing Data for Machine Learning\n",
    "- Categories (strings) are mapped to numeric labels using pandas `.map()` to allow model training, as models expect numeric targets    .\n",
    "- The balanced dataset is split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 ratio, using a `random_state` for reproducibility and `stratify` to maintain class distribution in both sets  .\n",
    "- Stratification ensures equal representation of all classes in train and test, preventing model bias towards majority classes   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "- A pipeline is created combining the vectorizer (bag of words or n-grams) and a classifier (Multinomial Naive Bayes recommended for text classification, though other classifiers like KNN, Random Forest, Decision Trees can be compared)   .\n",
    "- The model is trained on training data and predictions are made on the test set; performance is evaluated with a classification report showing metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score   .\n",
    "- Experimentation shows bag of words (unigrams) often performs better than bigrams or trigrams on this dataset, but results may vary based on problem specifics and require trial and error   .\n",
    "- Example predictions demonstrate correct classification of news categories, showing the model's practical application   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Effect of Preprocessing on Model Performance\n",
    "- Training the same model with preprocessed text (stop words removed, lemmatized) improves classification metrics compared to using raw text, as shown by higher F1-scores across most classes      .\n",
    "- Preprocessing is generally recommended for NLP tasks, though some cases may not benefit; it depends on the problem context  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practice and Further Learning\n",
    "- Exercises and additional resources (like confusion matrix plotting code) are provided in the video description and notebook to encourage hands-on practice, emphasizing that active coding is essential for mastering NLP and machine learning   .\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "> **ℹ️ Note:** The bag of n-grams approach extends bag of words by capturing contiguous sequences of tokens, improving contextual representation but increasing vocabulary size and computational cost. Preprocessing (stop word removal, lemmatization) enhances vector quality and model performance, especially in text classification tasks with imbalanced data handled via sampling techniques.  \n",

    "## TF-IDF Representation in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Background:** The video builds on the Bag of Words (BoW) and Bag of n-grams models used for text classification, focusing on classifying news articles by company mentions such as Tesla or Apple   .\n",
    "- **Issue with BoW:** Generic terms like \"price,\" \"market,\" \"investor\" appear frequently across documents and suppress meaningful, relevant terms (e.g., \"iphone,\" \"musk\"), misleading the model into thinking unrelated articles are similar due to these common words    .\n",
    "- **Stop Words Limitation:** Removing stop words helps but does not fully solve the problem because many generic but domain-relevant terms still affect the model's accuracy   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Frequency (DF):** Measures in how many documents a term appears, not how many times per document. For example, \"gigafactory\" appears in only one document, while \"price\" appears in three out of four documents  .\n",
    "- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** To reduce the influence of common terms, IDF is calculated as the logarithm of the ratio of total documents to the number of documents containing the term:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{IDF}(t) = \\log \\frac{N}{n_t}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  where \\(N\\) is total documents and \\(n_t\\) is documents containing term \\(t\\). Terms appearing in fewer documents get higher IDF scores, emphasizing their importance     .\n",
    "- **Use of Logarithm:** Logarithm dampens the effect of extremely high term frequencies, preventing rare terms from dominating and common terms from being overly penalized. The log function flattens as frequency increases, stabilizing influence    .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Term Frequency (TF) and Combining with IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Term Frequency (TF):** Normalizes word count by the total number of tokens in a document to account for document length differences:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\text{TF}(t,d) = \\frac{\\text{count of } t \\text{ in } d}{\\text{total words in } d}\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This prevents bias toward longer documents   .\n",
    "- **TF-IDF Score:** Calculated as the product of TF and IDF, balancing term importance within a document and across the corpus. Relevant terms have higher TF-IDF scores, while common terms get lower scores   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sparsity:** As vocabulary size grows, TF-IDF vectors become sparse, which can affect model performance  .\n",
    "- **Lack of Semantic Relationship:** TF-IDF does not capture relationships between words; unlike word or sentence embeddings, it only counts term frequency and document distribution  .\n",
    "- **Out-of-Vocabulary Problem:** Words not in the training vocabulary cannot be represented, limiting model generalization  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical TF-IDF Implementation (Using scikit-learn)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **TF-IDF Vectorizer:** Create an instance, then fit and transform a corpus (collection of documents) to generate TF-IDF vectors   .\n",
    "- **Vocabulary and IDF Scores:** Vocabulary maps terms to indices; IDF scores can be accessed via the vectorizer object to inspect term importance (e.g., common terms like \"is\" have low IDF, rare terms like \"apple\" have high IDF)      .\n",
    "- **TF-IDF Vectors:** Transformed output is a sparse matrix; converting it to an array allows inspection of TF-IDF scores per document and term      .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application: E-Commerce Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset:** Uses Amazon item descriptions labeled into four categories (e.g., electronics, household, books, clothing) with balanced classes (6000 items each)     .\n",
    "- **Label Encoding:** Converts categorical labels to numerical form for machine learning compatibility using pandas mapping functions   .\n",
    "- **Train-Test Split:** Splits data into 80% training and 20% testing sets using stratified sampling to preserve class balance   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classifiers Used:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Multinomial Naive Bayes classifiers are trained to compare performance   .\n",
    "- **Pipeline:** Utilizes sklearn pipelines to chain TF-IDF vectorization with classifiers for streamlined training and prediction   .\n",
    "- **Performance Metrics:** Classification reports show precision, recall, and F1 scores around 95-98%, indicating strong model performance across categories    .\n",
    "- **Prediction Inspection:** Individual predictions align well with true labels, showing the model's effectiveness in classifying e-commerce product descriptions    .\n",
    "- **Classifier Comparison:** Random Forest often yields the best performance, but choice depends on data and problem context; Naive Bayes is a common starting point for text classification    .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Preprocessing Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessing Steps:** Removal of stop words, punctuation, and lemmatization to normalize text improves model accuracy   .\n",
    "- **Implementation:** Applies preprocessing function to text column using pandas `.apply()` method, creating a new preprocessed text column   .\n",
    "- **Retraining:** Models trained on preprocessed text show slightly better F1 scores (up to 99%), confirming the value of preprocessing in text classification tasks   .\n",
    "- **General Guideline:** Preprocessing is recommended but effectiveness may vary depending on dataset and task  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning and Practice Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "> **💡 Key Insight:** Mastery of machine learning and NLP requires consistent practice beyond watching tutorials; coding along and completing exercises is essential for skill development.\n",

    "## Shortcomings of Traditional Text Vectorization Techniques\n",
    "- Traditional text vectorization methods often produce high-dimensional sparse vectors with many zeros and fail to capture the semantic meaning of words properly. For example, two similar sentences might have very different vectors under these methods, limiting their usefulness in understanding language meaning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Word Embeddings: Concept and Advantages\n",
    "- **Word embeddings** are dense, lower-dimensional vector representations of words (commonly 50, 100, or 300 dimensions) where similar words have similar vectors, effectively capturing semantic relationships. For instance, the vectors for \"good\" and \"great\" are close but not identical, reflecting their similarity.   \n",
    "- These dense vectors contrast with sparse vectors from older techniques, which had many zero values, improving efficiency and expressiveness.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Popular Word Embedding Techniques\n",
    "- Common word embedding methods include **Word2Vec**, **GloVe**, and **FastText**, which rely on approaches like Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-Gram models to learn word representations from large corpora.   \n",
    "- More recent transformer-based embeddings, such as **BERT** and **GPT**, represent advanced NLP models that capture context more effectively and are used in applications like Google Search.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Embedding Models and Their Foundations\n",
    "- Models like **ELMo** use LSTM-based architectures to generate embeddings, showing the diversity of techniques for capturing word meanings.  \n",
    "- These models convert words or sentences into vectors that not only represent meaning but also allow for arithmetic operations on vectors, revealing semantic relationships (e.g., \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" ≈ \"queen\"). This arithmetic property is a powerful demonstration of embedding capabilities.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Training Variations Based on Data Corpora\n",
    "- Word embedding models can be trained on different datasets (corpora), resulting in variations tailored to specific domains or language styles. For example, Word2Vec trained on Google News differs from one trained on Twitter data, the latter better capturing slang and informal language.  \n",
    "- Similarly, transformer-based models like BERT have domain-specific versions such as **BioBERT** for biomedical text and **FinBERT** for financial data, illustrating how training data influences embeddings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of Jargon and Further Learning Recommendations\n",
    "- Numerous jargons like Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, BERT, BioBERT, FinBERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and Virtuac represent various embedding techniques or model variants, often reflecting differences in architecture or training data.    \n",
    "- For a deeper understanding, especially of Word2Vec, dedicated tutorials are recommended as these foundational techniques underpin many NLP applications.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Purpose and Scope of Word Embeddings\n",
    "- The primary goal of word embedding techniques is to convert text—whether a single word, sentence, paragraph, or entire document—into numerical vectors that machines can process. This enables machine learning models to understand and work with textual data effectively. "

    "## Accessing Word Vectors in SpaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "- To use word vectors in SpaCy, you must load either the **medium** (`md`) or **large** (`lg`) English model, as the **small** model has no vectors (zero keys, zero unique vectors)   .\n",
    "- The medium model contains about 514 keys and vectors of 300 dimensions; the large model has many more unique vectors (around 20k) with the same dimension size   .\n",
    "- Install the large model via command line with `python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg`; expect a large download size and some time for installation  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Working with Tokens and Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can iterate over tokens in a document and check properties like `token.has_vector` (boolean if the token has a vector) and `token.is_oov` (out-of-vocabulary flag)  .\n",
    "- Common words like \"dog\", \"cat\", and \"banana\" have vectors, while random or regional words (e.g., \"kem's\") do not, because they were not seen in the training corpus   .\n",
    "- SpaCy uses **GloVe embeddings** trained on large English datasets (e.g., Wikipedia, news articles) to capture general English language knowledge  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector Representation and Dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each word vector is a 300-dimensional numpy array accessible by `token.vector` with shape `(300,)`   .\n",
    "- Sentence vectors in SpaCy are computed as the average of the individual word vectors in the sentence, so a single-word sentence vector equals that word’s vector  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Measuring Similarity Between Words\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similarity between two tokens can be computed using `token1.similarity(token2)`, which returns a value between 0 and 1, where 1 means identical vectors   .\n",
    "- Words appearing in similar contexts tend to have higher similarity scores. For example, \"bread\" and \"sandwich\" have a higher similarity than \"bread\" and \"car\" because they co-occur in related contexts   .\n",
    "- Similarity reflects **contextual closeness**, not semantic equivalence. Antonyms like \"profit\" and \"loss\" may have high similarity because they appear in similar contexts despite opposite meanings   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Function to Print Similarities\n",
    "\n",
    "- A reusable function can be created to compare a base word against a list of words, printing their similarity scores, facilitating quick exploration of vector similarities in SpaCy  .\n",

    "## Model Training and Challenges\n",
    "- Import and train a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier, commonly used for NLP tasks due to its effectiveness with text data.  \n",
    "- Multinomial Naive Bayes requires non-negative feature values; SpaCy vectors contain negative values causing errors.  \n",
    "- Apply Min-Max scaling to transform vectors into a positive range using `MinMaxScaler` from scikit-learn. Use `fit_transform` on training data and `transform` on test data to maintain consistency.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Evaluation\n",
    "- After training, predict labels on the test set and generate a classification report showing precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.  \n",
    "- The multinomial Naive Bayes model achieves robust results with over 90% in key metrics, demonstrating effectiveness using SpaCy embeddings.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative Classifier: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "- Train a KNN classifier (with k=5 neighbors) on the same SpaCy vector features; KNN typically struggles with high-dimensional sparse data but performs well with dense 300-dimensional vectors.  \n",
    "- KNN achieves near-perfect precision and recall (~99%), outperforming previous TF-IDF or bag-of-ngrams approaches where KNN struggled due to high dimensionality.  \n",
    "- Dense embeddings reduce dimensionality issues, allowing KNN to excel compared to sparse vector representations.   \n",

    "- **Gensim** is a Python NLP library primarily used for topic modeling, similar to SpaCy, but with a convenient API for word vectors, making it a good choice for working with word embeddings   .\n",
    "- Word embeddings in Gensim can be loaded using the `API.load()` method, where you specify the dataset or model type, such as the Google News pretrained Word2Vec model   .\n",
    "- The **Google News Word2Vec model** is large (~1.6 GB), trained on 100 billion words, and contains about 3 million word vectors, making it suitable for large-scale NLP tasks   .\n",

    "## Understanding Word Vector Similarity in Gensim\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `similarity()` function measures the similarity between two words based on their contexts, not strict synonyms; for example, \"great\" and \"good\" have a similarity score around 0.7   .\n",
    "- Similarity reflects how often words appear in similar contexts, not semantic equivalence, which explains why antonyms like \"good\" and \"bad\" can have high similarity if they share surrounding words in training corpora   .\n",
    "- This contextual similarity is a key feature of word embeddings, distinguishing them from traditional models like TF-IDF or bag-of-words that lack semantic understanding   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Examples of Word Embedding Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- Words like \"dog,\" \"puppy,\" and \"Golden Retriever\" cluster closely because they appear in similar contexts; similarly, \"cat\" and \"dog\" are similar due to shared usage contexts in training data  .\n",
    "- Vector arithmetic on embeddings can reveal meaningful relationships, e.g., $$\\text{France} - \\text{Paris} + \\text{Berlin} = \\text{Germany}$$, illustrating how embeddings capture semantic structure beyond word co-occurrence   .\n",
    "- Gensim's `most_similar()` method supports positive and negative examples to perform such vector arithmetic and returns results ranked by similarity, e.g., Queen is the result of $$\\text{King} - \\text{Man} + \\text{Woman}$$   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Gensim APIs for Semantic Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `doesnt_match()` method identifies the odd word out in a list based on semantic fit, e.g., in a list of company names with \"cat\" included, \"cat\" would be identified as not matching  .\n",
    "- This demonstrates Gensim's ability to understand language context and semantic categories beyond simple word matching  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparing Models and Their Contextual Influence\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loading different pretrained models (e.g., Twitter 25 model trained on 2 billion tweets) can yield different similarity results due to domain-specific training data influencing word contexts   .\n",
    "- For example, similarity results for \"good\" differ significantly between Google News and Twitter models, reflecting the different language use in news articles vs. tweets  .\n",
    "- Semantic tasks such as `most_similar()` and `doesnt_match()` work across models but results depend on the underlying training corpus and embedding technique (Word2Vec vs. GloVe)   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Concepts and Clarifications\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Similarity in word embeddings refers to contextual similarity, not synonymy or antonymy.** Words appearing in similar contexts have high similarity scores, regardless of their dictionary meanings.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "- Word embeddings are trained using self-supervised learning on large text corpora, generating training samples automatically from context windows without labeled data  .\n",
    "- Using pretrained embeddings in NLP models helps capture semantic relationships and generalize better to unseen but semantically related words, unlike traditional sparse vector models  .\n",
    "- Multiple libraries (Gensim, SpaCy, PyTorch) support loading pretrained embeddings, but Gensim offers a convenient API for vector operations and semantic queries   .\n",
    "- Different embedding algorithms (Word2Vec, GloVe) and datasets (Google News, Twitter) affect the size, vocabulary, and quality of the embeddings, so choosing the right model depends on the application domain    .\n",

    "    \"Michigan governor denies misleading U.S. House on Flint water (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder denied Thursday that he had misled a U.S. House of Representatives committee last year over testimony on Flintâ€™s water crisis after lawmakers asked if his testimony had been contradicted by a witness in a court hearing. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee wrote Snyder earlier Thursday asking him about published reports that one of his aides, Harvey Hollins, testified in a court hearing last week in Michigan that he had notified Snyder of an outbreak of Legionnairesâ€™ disease linked to the Flint water crisis in December 2015, rather than 2016 as Snyder had testified. â€œMy testimony was truthful and I stand by it,â€ Snyder told the committee in a letter, adding that his office has provided tens of thousands of pages of records to the committee and would continue to cooperate fully.  Last week, prosecutors in Michigan said Dr. Eden Wells, the stateâ€™s chief medical executive who already faced lesser charges, would become the sixth current or former official to face involuntary manslaughter charges in connection with the crisis. The charges stem from more than 80 cases of Legionnairesâ€™ disease and at least 12 deaths that were believed to be linked to the water in Flint after the city switched its source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in April 2014. Wells was among six current and former Michigan and Flint officials charged in June.

    "## Overview of Word Embedding Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "- Word2Vec uses two main architectures for word embeddings: Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) predicts a target word from its context, while Skip-gram predicts context words from a target word. Both train a neural network whose weights serve as word embeddings    .\n",
    "- Word2Vec treats the **word as the smallest unit** for training the neural network, which can cause problems with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words if they do not appear in the training corpus  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to FastText\n",
    "\n",
    "- FastText is similar to Word2Vec but differs by training on **character n-grams** instead of whole words, capturing subword information (e.g., for \"capable\" with n=3, n-grams include \"cap\", \"apa\", \"pab\", etc.)   .\n",
    "- This subword modeling enables FastText to handle OOV words effectively because it can infer embeddings from known character n-grams even if the full word was unseen during training  .\n",
    "- FastText is often the **first choice for training custom embeddings in specialized domains** due to its efficiency and ability to handle domain-specific vocabulary better than Word2Vec or BERT    .\n",
    "\n",
    "## FastText: Technique and Library\n",
    "\n",
    "- FastText is both a **technique and a library** developed by Facebook Research, providing pre-trained models and Python modules for easy use   .\n",
    "- Pre-trained FastText models are available for many languages and are trained on large corpora such as Wikipedia and Common Crawl, enabling them to capture general language properties   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Pre-trained FastText Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- The FastText Python API allows loading pre-trained models and accessing word vectors, nearest neighbors, and analogies   .\n",
    "- Nearest neighbors in FastText embeddings reflect **contextual similarity, not synonyms or antonyms**; e.g., \"good\" and \"bad\" appear close because they occur in similar contexts   .\n",
    "- FastText vectors have a typical dimension of 300, and methods like `get_word_vector` and `get_analogies` demonstrate semantic relationships (e.g., Berlin:Germany :: Delhi:India)   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain-Specific Training Example: Indian Food Recipes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pre-trained general models may perform poorly on domain-specific terms (e.g., Indian food items like \"chutney\" or regional terms like \"saragua\") because such terms are rare or absent in general corpora   .\n",
    "- Training a FastText model on a specialized dataset (e.g., Indian food recipes) involves cleaning the text data (removing special characters, extra spaces, converting to lowercase) using regular expressions for better quality input   .\n",
    "- Exporting the cleaned recipe text into a plain text file with one recipe per line prepares the data for unsupervised FastText training   .\n",
    "- Training uses FastText’s `train_unsupervised` method, typically with skip-gram by default, which generates word embeddings tailored to the domain-specific language   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Custom FastText Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom-trained FastText models provide **more meaningful nearest neighbor results** for domain-specific terms compared to general models, reflecting better understanding of the domain vocabulary and relationships    .\n",
    "- This approach helps improve NLP tasks in specialized fields by producing embeddings that capture relevant semantic nuances not present in general language models   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## FastText Model Hyperparameters and Further Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "- FastText training supports tuning of hyperparameters such as model type (`cbow` or `skipgram`), embedding dimension, number of epochs, learning rate, and number of threads to optimize performance for specific datasets   .\n",
    "- Users are encouraged to experiment with these parameters to improve model quality when training on custom data  .\n",
    "- The FastText library website provides tutorials and resources for deeper exploration, including supervised tasks like text classification  .\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Text Preprocessing Using Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "- To prepare text for fastText modeling, all punctuation and special characters must be removed, and text converted to lowercase without extra whitespace. This cleaning is done using regular expressions (regex)   .\n",
    "- In regex, `\\s` matches any whitespace character (spaces, tabs), and `\\w` matches any word character (letters, digits, underscore). Characters that are neither word characters nor whitespace can be targeted for removal or substitution   .\n",
    "- Using `re.sub()`, all special characters can be substituted with a space. For example, the pattern `[^\\w\\s]` matches any character that is not a word character or whitespace, enabling their removal to clean the text   .\n",
    "- To reduce multiple consecutive spaces to a single space, the pattern `\\s+` (one or more spaces) is replaced with a single space. The `strip()` method removes leading/trailing spaces, and `lower()` converts text to lowercase for normalization    .\n",
    "- This preprocessing step is encapsulated in a function that can be applied to an entire pandas DataFrame column using `map()` or `apply()`, enabling batch cleaning of text data   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing Data for fastText Training\n",
    "\n",
    "- After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, typically using an 80/20 split, resulting in two DataFrames with separate labeled samples for model training and evaluation   .\n",
    "- fastText’s supervised learning function, `train_supervised()`, requires input data in a specific text file format where each line contains a label and the corresponding item description. The training and test DataFrames are saved as CSV files without headers or indices to meet this format   .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training and Evaluating the fastText Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `train_supervised()` method in fastText is used for text classification. Unlike previous use for word embeddings, here it combines embedding generation with classification training  .\n",
    "- Model evaluation is done on the test set using precision and recall metrics. Precision indicates the percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions made, with a typical example showing 96% precision, indicating strong model performance  .\n",
    "- The model’s prediction API is simple: given an input string, it predicts the most likely category label (e.g., Electronics, Books, Clothing) based on the learned embeddings and classification model  .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Model Capabilities and Practical Advice\n",
    "\n",
    "- The trained fastText model retains word embeddings, allowing tasks like finding nearest neighbors to a word (similar words) using `model.get_nearest_neighbors()`. This can reveal semantically related terms learned during training  .\n",
    "- Practical learning requires active coding practice alongside video tutorials to reinforce understanding and skills in text classification with fastText   .\n",

    "- **Flow-based (Rule-based) Chatbots:** These operate via fixed menu options or decision trees where users select predefined choices step-by-step, requiring no machine learning, only simple if-else programming. Examples include Verizon Wireless and PNC Bank chatbots that guide users through hierarchical options like plan management or payments    .\n",
    "- **NLP-based Flow Chatbots:** These understand free-form English queries within a specific domain, parsing user intent and responding accordingly. Examples include Capital One’s Eno chatbot, which understands varied phrasings about credit and transactions, and Domino’s chatbot, which processes natural language orders and validates inputs like addresses    .\n",
    "- **Open-ended Chatbots:** These support unrestricted, multi-topic conversations without fixed domains. ChatGPT exemplifies this, capable of handling diverse questions and changing topics fluidly, unlike rule-based bots with limited scope    .\n",
